## The original Idea of adding extra windows on    ##
## the XChat client was firstly implemented by	   ##
## mathews_dm for GamesNet and each needs.	       ##
##						                                     ##
## Part of the code was erased/replaced and/or     ##
## modified by me in order to cover the needs of   ##
## an IRC Operator on a Bahamut IRCdaemon with	   ##
## Anope Services.				   				               ##
##		   				 			                    			   ##
## Credits goes to mathews_dm for the basic/most   ##
## part of the code, Powered, KiD and Athan for    ##
## their own mIRC scripts for Server Notices	     ##
## Segregation which gave me the text to be added  ##
## in order to cover a GRNet's IRC Operator needs. ##
